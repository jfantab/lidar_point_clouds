The `matlab` folder holds the developer kit code for the Raw Data dataset and the Object Detection dataset.

`fuse.ipynb` holds the sensor fusion code for the Raw Data dataset. `fuse2.ipynb` is the same set of code but for the Object Detection dataset. The utility functions for working with the KITTI dataset are in `kitti_utils.py`.

`convert_calib.ipynb` is the code used to convert the camera calibration files from the Raw Data dataset format into the Objet Detection dataset format.
